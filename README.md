# Complex-numbers
Define a structure called complex that is used for complex numbers and following functions: 
- a function to display a complex variable. 
- a function to receive real and imaginary parts of a complex variable from user. 
- a function to conjugate a complex variable. 
- a function to compute magnitude of a complex variable.  
- a function to compute angle of a complex variable. Use double atan2(double y, double x) from &lt;math.h>. 
- a function to divide two complex variables. 
- a function to subtract two complex variables. 
- a function to multiply two complex variables. 
- a function to add two complex variables.
Test your functions in a program.
